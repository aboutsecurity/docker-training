    "1. Pulling an Image\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  Run the command: `docker pull nginx`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Running a Container\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Run the command: `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Explanation:** \n",
    "\n",
    "        - `-d` runs the container in detached mode (background)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - `-p` 80:80 maps port 80 of the container to port 80 on your host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The official Docker ngnix image can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Verifying the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost`. You should see the Nginx welcome page.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   In your terminal, type: `docker ps` to list running containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stopping and Removing\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Get the container ID from `docker ps`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Stop the container: docker stop <container_id>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Remove the container: docker rm <container_id>\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Bonus command-line tricks for cleaning up unused containers and freeing up disk space:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - `docker ps -a -q`: This command lists all containers, including stopped ones (-a flag), and extracts only their container IDs (-q flag). It provides a list of container IDs that have exited or are currently stopped.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - `docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)`: Stops all running containers\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`: Removes all containers"

    "1. Create a Working Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create a new directory for this exercise (e.g., docker-training): `mkdir docker-training`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Change into that directory: `cd docker-training`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a Simple Web Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Inside the docker-training directory, create an index.html file with some basic content (e.g., “Hello, Docker!”).\n",
    "    \n",
    "        `echo \"Hello, Docker\" > index.html`\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a Dockerfile\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create a Dockerfile (case-sensitive) in the same directory: `touch Dockerfile`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use a text editor or code editor to edit Dockerfile:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        # Dockerfile\n",
    "        FROM nginx\n",
    "        COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Build the Custom Image\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile: `docker build -t my-web-app .` (Don't forget the period at the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - `-t my-web-app`: The -t option stands for \"tag\". This part of the command tags the resulting image with a name and optionally a tag in the 'name:tag' format. If you don't specify a tag, Docker will assign the latest tag by default. Here, my-web-app is the name you're giving to the Docker image. This makes it easier to reference the image later, for example, when you want to run a container based on this image.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - `.`: This specifies the context for the build. In Docker, the build context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL. The Docker build process can use any files in the context to build the image. In this case, . means the current directory you're in when you run the command. Docker will look for a Dockerfile in this directory to build the image. If your Dockerfile is named differently or located elsewhere, you would need to use the -f option to specify the path to the Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Start a container from the custom image: `docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-web-app`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`\n",
    "\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Running Commands Inside the Container\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check what user the container is running as: `docker exec -it <container_id> whoami`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - `docker exec`: This is the main command that tells Docker to execute a specific command inside a running container.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - `it`: This option is a combination of -i and -t flags:\n",
    "        \n",
    "            - `i` (or --interactive) keeps STDIN open even if not attached. This allows you to interact with the command if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - `t` (or --tty) allocates a pseudo-TTY, which means it simulates a terminal, similar to what you would get if you were to log into a session on the container. This is useful for commands that require a terminal to operate properly, like shell sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - `whoami`: This is the command to be executed inside the container. whoami is a UNIX command that displays the username of the current user. When run in the context of this Docker command, it will display the username of the user inside the container, not the host machine.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - In the same docker-training directory, create a docker-compose.yml file: `touch docker-compose.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use a text editor or code editor to edit docker-compose.yml:\n",

    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "         - **Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - `version: '3'`: This specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. Version 3 is suitable for running with Docker Engine version 1.13.0+ and Docker Compose 1.10.0+. It supports defining services, networks, and volumes at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - The services key is used to configure the containers that make up your application. Here, two services are defined: web and db.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - `image`: `nginx:alpine`: This line specifies that the web service uses the nginx:alpine image. This is a lightweight version of the Nginx web server packaged in the Alpine Linux distribution. `postgres:latest`: This line specifies that the db service uses the latest version of the postgres image. This container will run a PostgreSQL database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - `ports`: This section maps ports between the host and the container, allowing external access to services on a container.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - `\"8081:80\"`: This maps port 8081 on the host to port 80 on the container. This means that the Nginx server inside the container, which listens on port 80, can be accessed on port 8081 from the host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - `environment`: This section allows you to set environment variables inside the container. For the db service, two environment variables are set: \n",
    "            \n",
    "                - `POSTGRES_USER: myuser`: Sets the default username for the PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "                - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mypassword`: Sets the password for the PostgreSQL database. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "            This Docker Compose file sets up a simple web application environment with two services: an Nginx web server and a PostgreSQL database. The Nginx server is accessible from the host machine on port 8081, and the PostgreSQL database is configured with a specified username and password. This setup is useful for development and testing environments where you need a straightforward web server and database setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Start the Services\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Run the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file: `docker-compose up -d` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Access the Web Server:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:8081`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You should see the default Nginx page.\n",
    "\n",
